<h2>Create a simple calculator using enums and pattern matching</h2>

 Task Details
-  In this task, students will create a simple calculator in Rust that can perform basic arithmetic operations using enums and pattern matching.

  Steps
-  Create an enum called Operation with variants Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide. Each variant should hold two f64 values.
-  Create a function called calculate that takes an Operation enum as an argument and returns an f64 result.
-  Implement the calculate function using pattern matching to perform the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the variant of the Operation enum.
-  In the main function, prompt the user to input the first number, the operation to be performed, and the second number.
-  Parse the user input into appropriate variables.
-  Create an Operation enum instance with the parsed input values.
-  Call the calculate function with the created Operation enum instance.
-  Print the result to the console.
-  Compile and run the program to ensure it works as expected.


Checklist 
-  Define the Operation enum with the appropriate variants and values.
-  Write the calculate function signature.
-  Implement the calculate function using pattern matching to perform the appropriate arithmetic operation.
-  Prompt the user to input the first number, operation, and second number.
-  Parse the user input into appropriate variables.
-  Create an Operation enum instance with the parsed input values.
-  Call the calculate function with the created Operation enum instance.
-  Print the result to the console.
-  Compile and run the program to test its functionality.
